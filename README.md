# Discrete and continuous probability distributions:
Different Types of Distribution

1) **Binomial distribution**
The binomial distribution is one of the important mathematical distribution used in many business situations. It is a discrete probability distribution. It is type of probability experiment to check the 2 possible outcomes that is Pass or Fail. For example: coin tossed has 2 possible outcomes either heads or tails. [22]
It explains the outcome of n independent trials in an experiment. Each test is assumed to have only two result, either success or failure. If the probability of a successful trial is p,
36
 then the probability of having x successful outcomes in an experiment of n independent trials is as follows.
𝑃(𝑋) = 𝑛! . (𝑝)𝑋 ⋅ (𝑞)𝑛−𝑋 (𝑛 − 𝑋)! 𝑋!
X = total number of successes (pass/fail, heads/tails etc.)
P = probability of a success on an individual trial
n = number of trials
q = probability of failure (subtract your probability of success from 1).


**Example 14:** 70% of people who purchase auto insurance are men. If 8 auto insurance owners are randomly selected, find the probability that exactly 5 are men.
Solution: 
Step 1: n is 8.
Step 2: X is 5.
Step 3: first part of the formula is
𝑛! (𝑛−𝑋)!𝑋!
Substitute the variables:
8! (8−5)!5!
= 57
Step 4: Find p and q.
p is the probability of success and q is the probability of failure. We are given p = 70%, or .7. So, the probability of failure is 1 – .7 = .3 (30%).

Step 5: Work the second part of the formula.
(𝑝)𝑋 = (0.7)5
= .16807

Step 6: Work the third part of the formula. =(𝑞)𝑛−𝑋
= (0.3)8−5
   37
 = .0027
Step 7: Multiply your answer from step 3, 5, and 6 together. 56 × .16807 × .0027= 0.25412
The probability of exactly 5 men who will buy auto insurance is 0.25412.
